# bt-hq-shader-converter
A command-line modding tool that recreates the gradient shading (albeit with flaws) used for Tenkaichi HQ mods.

# Breakdown
This is a table containing the colors of a gradient generated by Game Graphic Studio.

The colors with index 0 and 32 are taken from Goku (End)'s face shader.

In case it was not obvious, R, G & B represent the amounts of Red, Green & Blue from each color, whereas R-Delta, G-Delta & B-Delta represent the differences in Red, Green & Blue between two consecutive colors.

R-New, G-New and B-New represent a new series of colors, where the average step is being subtracted from the previous color.

Meanwhile, R-Round, G-Round & B-Round are the rounded values of R-New, G-New & B-New.

The results are pretty close to what Game Graphic Studio offers, but not necessarily ideal.
